The Bored Traveller. Wanders around cyberspace until he or she's too tired.

This is my first Python 'App'. It's an application of what I learned while taking the course "Python for Everybody" on Coursera.
As you can probably tell, all it does is wander around the entire internet from a designated starting website until it either reaches the limit or when the addresses list is empty.
I would love to get some assistance on this, because so far it just crashes with a traceback when that occurs.

I will be actively doing research and attempt to modify/fix this issue as well as enrich the program by having it make a database, etc.

Lastly forgive me for my lack of knowledge towards everything; I just barely started coding. Enjoy!
